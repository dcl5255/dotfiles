# dotfiles

A collection of configs for different tools that I use while developing

- [zsh](#zsh) (shell)
- [alacritty](#alacritty) (terminal)
- [nvim](#neovim) (editor)
- [tmux](#tmux) (terminal multiplexer)

## Installation Notes

### Configurations
My dotfiles are managed through this git repo along with [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink individual configs to their respective locations in the home directory, allowing me to modify configs in one spot easily

Included with this repo is a `makefile` that contains two targets: `all` and `delete`
- Running `make` will use stow to create or regenerate symlinks
- Running `make delete` will remove all of those symlinks

### zsh
- Install with apt: `apt install zsh`
- Set to default shell with `chsh -s /use/bin/zsh`

### alacritty
Note: This repo currently assumes alacritty versions < 13, as [configuration was changed from yaml to toml](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/commit/bd4906722a1a026b01f06c94c33b13ff63a7e044) and I haven't gotten around to updating my config just yet

- Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty). I typically build the source with `cargo build --release`
- In gnome, update default terminal with `sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator`
  - "Open with Terminal" context menu continued to open gnome-terminal

### neovim
- Install with apt: `apt install neovim`
- I use Packer to manage my plugins. Follow the [quickstart's installation](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart) and Run `:PackerCompile`, `:PackerInstall` within nvim to update everything

### tmux
- Install with apt: `apt install tmux`
- I use [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) to manage and install tmux plugins. Use `prefix I` to fetch new plugins
